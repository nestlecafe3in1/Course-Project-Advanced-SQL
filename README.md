Mid Course Project for Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence

Advanced SQL: MySQL Data Analysis & Business Intelligence is a project-based course where I play the role of an analyst for an e-commerce business where I help different executives understanding the performance of the company to solve some of the problems presented in the same. 

For this mid course project, my objective is to tell the story of my company's growth using trended performance data, explain some of the details around your growth story and quantify the revenue impact of some of my big wins.
